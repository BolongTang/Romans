To clarify the meaning of a biblical passage requires careful exposition. To this end, this experimental repository converts selected passages in Romans into code format using Python. Note that code itself cannot prove correctness of reading, only structure and extend existing thoughts.

**DESCRIPTIONS**

Each file like Romans2.py defines objects and methods relevant to specific concepts appearing in the passage. 

Each test case in files starting with "Test" illustrates a decision framework (ex. assessing whethere someone is righteous or a hypocrite) with an example. 

Certain implementations such as .violate() in Law() are primitive--they are too simple to have real-world usages, but they exist to allow illustrations in the unit tests.

**USAGES**

Run `git clone https://github.com/BolongTang/Romans.git` to clone all files to your local machine, and add illustrations by adding tests to TestRomans2.py.
